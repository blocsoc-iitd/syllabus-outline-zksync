# Syllabus outline ZkSync Summer Bootcamp:

## Goal:

By the end of the boot camp, all the boot campers should get a clear overview of Zero-knowledge and ZK math, and they should be able to write ZK Circuits & create ZK applications on their own, together with having a good overview of the Blockchain ecosystem.

## Timings: 

- Kickoff: 6th or 7th of May 2024, offline.

- Number of Weeks: 8 Week(s) + 1 Week.

- Number of days a week: 
    - Content for five days, up to the boot camp.
    - 2 online sessions a week.
    - 1 online session will be on giving an overview of the week's syllabus. (think of it as video lectures in MOOC).
    - The other session could be doubt-solving or an overview session.

## Content:

- General Recommendation: Learn Rust from Day 0. 
- zustlings
- Reading?

// BLOCKCHAIN OVERVIEW


### Week 1: "Primitives" 
- General intro to [[Ethereum, Solana.]] << Blockchain? >>
  - Trade-offs // "Trade spaces" Design decisions made by protocols to prioritize different things ?
- How do [[ Ethereum & Solana ]] work at the consensus and execution layer? << blockchain? >>
- Role of consensus layer. << How does this relate? Base Layer? L1? >>

Additional content(only for those interested): Docs of Alchemy / Alchemy University to build a DApp. << can be cryptozombies, chainshot, encode >>

### Week:

This week acts as a starter to Rust for everyone and to make everyone code in Rust at a basic level. 

- Development on Ethereum(probably in Rust/GO ðŸ˜‰).
  - Protocol-level Development (P2P, Transaction Processing, "Node / Client Development") 

### Week: "Primitives are assembled to make:"

This week gives an overview of most of the essential concepts in web3.

- OP Rollups, ZK Rollups, Validiums.
- DA Layers, Alt VMs(MoveVM, WasmVM, Solana VM)
- Consensus Layers


### Week : Use Cases?
- Decentralised Identities, Bridges(ZK and non ZK bridges).
- 

### The Road Forward for Blockchain?
- Ethereum's Rollup-centric roadmap and alt narratives...
- DA Layers, Alt VMs(MoveVM, WasmVM, Solana VM)
- Protodanksharding
- Modular vs Monolithic Execution


// ZK OVERVIEW

// TODO: Distinguish these a bit

### Week 4: Intro to ZK

- What is ZK?





- What is a SNARK & STARK? 
- Types of SNARKs & STARKS.
- Fields & Groups.
- Circom/Gnark.

### Week 5- Week 7: Rust + ZK  --> Circuit writing in rust.

The most crucial part of the boot camp. Those who complete this can understand and write circuits and build Zk Dapps independently.



SNARKs
- Groth 16, Plonk
- Starks, AIR, Plonkish Systems
- Plonky2, Halo2, KGZ, NOVA (folding scheme / IVC), IPA, Pedersen commitments...

STARKs
- Lookups, Range checks
- DEEP FRI, Recursion
- FFT, NTT, Fiat Shamir, Lagrange Basis, Low degree extensions.

## Advanced Topics
- Libraries -> Ark works/lambda works (Winterfell, bellman)
- Folding Schemes
IVC, NOVA
- ZK ML
- "Programmable Encryption"

These are taught in theory and code.

### Week 

### Week 8:

- ZK EVM, ZK Rollups.
- Sequencers
- ZK-DSL(s)


### Extra Week :

- More on ZK Math.
- ZK ML
