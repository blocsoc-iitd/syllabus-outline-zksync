# Syllabus outline ZkSync Summer Bootcamp:

## Goal:

By the end of the boot camp, all the boot campers should get a clear overview of Zero-knowledge and ZK math, and they should be able to write ZK Circuits & create ZK applications on their own, together with having a good overview of the Blockchain ecosystem.

## Timings: 

- Kickoff: 6th or 7th of May 2024, offline.

- Number of Weeks: 8 Week(s) + 1 Week.

- Number of days a week: 
    - Content for five days, up to the boot camp.
    - 2 online sessions a week.
    - 1 online session will be on giving an overview of the week's syllabus. (think of it as video lectures in MOOC).
    - The other session could be doubt-solving or an overview session.

## Content:

- General Recommendation: Learn Rust from Day 0. 
- zustlings
- Reading?

// BLOCKCHAIN OVERVIEW


### Week 1: Intro to L1 "Primitives" 
- General intro to Blockchain
  - Decentralised Systems
- Blockchain Timeline
- Layer1 Theory
- Blockchain Components
- Chains Overview
  - How do [[ Ethereum & Solana ]] work at the consensus and execution layer?
  - Trade-offs // "Trade spaces" Design decisions made by protocols to prioritize different things. Ethereum vs Solana etc.
  - Modular vs Monolithic Execution (<< Could also put this in Scalability section>>)
  - Alt VMs (touch on briefly)

### Week 2: Protocol Development Deep-Dive

This week acts as a starter to Rust for everyone and to make everyone code in Rust at a basic level. 

- Development on Ethereum(probably in Rust/GO ðŸ˜‰).
  - Protocol-level Development (P2P, Transaction Processing, "Node / Client Development") 
  - [[ Perhaps you'd want to check out the "Consensus" section from [this course](https://github.com/ConsenSys-Academy/Blockchain-Developer-Bootcamp/tree/1c47761d403026d55f54b36f62e33b1127e8da61/docs/S01-fundamentals) I built at Consensys]]
