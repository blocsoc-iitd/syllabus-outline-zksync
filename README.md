# Syllabus outline ZkSync Summer Bootcamp:

## Goal:

By the end of the boot camp, all the boot campers should get a clear overview of Zero-knowledge and ZK math, and they should be able to write ZK Circuits & create ZK applications on their own, together with having a good overview of the Blockchain ecosystem.

## Timings: 

- Kickoff: 5th May 2024, offline.

- Number of Weeks: 8 Week(s) + 1 Week.

- Number of days a week: 
    - Content for five days, up to the boot camp.
    - 2 online sessions a week.
    - 1 online session will be on giving an overview of the week's syllabus. (think of it as video lectures in MOOC).
    - The other session could be doubt-solving or an overview session.



## Week 1: Intro to L1 "Primitives" 

Lecture By Rahul Saxena: https://youtu.be/cUYeTqiKLtg?si=RmW1Cq1SW_fPufU1
- General intro to Blockchain
  - Decentralised Systems
- Blockchain Timeline
- Layer1 Theory
- Blockchain Components

Additional Content (only for those interested):

- [Bitcoin White Paper Exercises](https://github.com/cooganb/bitcoin-whitepaper-exercises) These are a series of exercises, built by [Kyle Simpson,](https://github.com/getify){target=_blank} for understanding some of the concepts outlined in the Bitcoin white paper. These are not easy, but if you really would like to understand these fundamentals as they apply to blockchains, this is a great place to start.
 - [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/)"A fun free platform for learning modern cryptography"
 - [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/) This is *very* advanced and intense, but real to-the-metal applied cryptography! I am putting this link in here and it scares me.


## Week 2: Protocol Development Deep-Dive

This week acts as a starter to Rust for everyone and to make everyone code in Rust at a basic level.

Things might seem confusing and tough to understand, but keep reading and exploring. Remember, blockchain's holy grail is creating a decentralized and secure network with a high transaction-per-second rate. Achieving this requires developing sophisticated mechanisms, such as implementing rollups with zero-knowledge proofs and fault-proof systems.

##### RESOURCES FROM DOUBT SESSION

1. Tornado Cash (a use case implementation of zero-knowledge proofs) Refer to the following Rare Skills blog. It explains it thoroughly in a good 30-45 min read: https://www.rareskills.io/post/how-does-tornado-cash-work

2. For those already done with rust, implement a few programs to get a good command of it. Some recommended stuff will be to : 

a) Implement a simple blockchain in Rust.
https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-a-blockchain-in-rust/

b) You can develop random things ( CLI, torrent clients ) from scratch to test and improve Rust, which will take a day's effort.
https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x?tab=readme-ov-file

c) ADVANCED:  You can try creating proofs for your Rust program and have them verified. Will give you a basic intuition of how zero-knowledge proofs are being implemented.

https://dev.risczero.com/api/

https://succinctlabs.github.io/sp1/

3. Refer to the following resources for those interested and wanting to get some initial readings and resources on Zero-knowledge proofs. It's recommended to use the ZK-Book with patience in detail, while the others can be used as extra resources, used randomly however you want.

https://www.rareskills.io/zk-book

https://zkiap.com/

https://zkhack.dev/whiteboard/

4. Practice GO a bit parallelly. You can use the resources shared earlier to learn GO. And for those who have some experience in GO and want to do some blockchain-relevant stuff with it, you can check out the Avalanche ecosystem.

https://docs.avax.network/

https://academy.avax.network/start

You can try implementing precompiles in the Avalanche Subnet EVM. It's a good task that will give you a good idea of many underlying blockchain concepts. It can be tough to grasp initially, but if you are confident enough in your basics, it would be fun to look through the weekend.
